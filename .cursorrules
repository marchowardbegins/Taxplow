# --- Global rules for Taxplow site ---
- No gradients; white backgrounds only.
- Use Font Awesome 4.7 classes (fa, fa-quote-left, fa-check-square-o, etc.). Do NOT load FA 5/6.
- Keep Netlify-friendly relative paths; don’t hardcode external domains unless already used.
- No Kartra/Wealthfront/Amazon scripts or trackers.
- Keep HTML/CSS/JS vanilla; no React or frameworks unless I explicitly ask.
- Keep icons visible: ensure FA 4.7 CSS is linked near end of <head>.
- Accessibility: keep button/link semantics correct; add aria-labels when adding icons.
- Performance: prefer local assets; lazy-load videos; don’t inline huge base64 images.
- Structure: do NOT delete existing sections; if replacing, keep IDs and anchors stable.
